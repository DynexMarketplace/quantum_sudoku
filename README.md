# Quantum Sudoku
Sudoku is a numerical logic puzzle that involves filling a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids or "boxes." Each row, column, and box must contain all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The puzzle begins with some of the cells pre-filled with numbers, serving as clues. The objective is to complete the grid while adhering to the rule that each number can appear only once in each row, column, and box. The challenge and complexity of the puzzle vary based on the number and placement of the initial digits.

This is a new quantum algorithm designed specifically to tackle Sudoku puzzles. This development isn't just about gaming; it demonstrates the robust capabilities of the Dynex quantum computing platform. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, this algorithm not only speeds up solutions for recreational puzzles but also showcases potential applications in complex logistics, optimization problems, and beyond.

# Usage

1. Launch in Github Codespaces and wait until the codepsace is fully initialised

2. Add your account keys by drag&drop of your dynex.ini into the main folder

3. Run the demo by typing the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The program will output and save the solved Sudoku in the file "result.png".
